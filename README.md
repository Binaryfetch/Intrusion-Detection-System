# **INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM**
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and issues alerts when such activity is discovered. It is a software application that scans a network or a system for the harmful activity or policy breaching.

						<h3>Three Types of Intruders</h3>
					</div>
					<ul style="padding-top: 40px;">
						<li>Masquerader: An unauthorized person uses our system and exploit legitimate users account,
							usually an outsider.</li>
						<li style="padding-top: 15px;">Misfeasor: legitimate users only but no authorization even if
							authorized, he/she will misuse their privilages, usually an insider. </li>
						<li style="padding-top: 15px;">Clandestine User: A person who takes the supreme control of the
							system and stops access to legitimate users. </li>
					</ul>

						<h4>Detection Method of IDS:</h4>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li>Signature-based Method:
							Signature-based IDS detects the attacks on the basis of the specific patterns such as number
							of bytes or number of 1's or number of 0's in the network traffic.</li>
						<li>Anomaly-based Method:
							Anomaly-based IDS was introduced to detect unknown malware attacks as new malware are
							developed rapidly.</li>
					</ol>

						<h3>Types of IDS</h3>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li style="font-size: 30px;">Host-Based IDS (HIDS): A host-based IDS is deployed on a particular
							endpoint and designed to protect it against internal and external threats.</li>
                   <div>	
				 </div>
						<li style="font-size: 30px;">Network-Based IDS (NIDS):A network-based IDS solution is designed
							to monitor an entire protected
							network.</li>
  <li>
							Hybrid Intrusion Detection System: Hybrid intrusion detection system is made by the
							combination of two or more approaches of the intrusion detection system.
